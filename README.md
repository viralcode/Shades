Shades is a  chrome extension for changing your old and boring New tab page. We are using the Javascript module pattern for client side 
development. Our team used Chrome browser api and some third party apis for achieving the goals. The layout is created using the
bootstrap library and some javascript functionalities are made by Jquery.

We want your support to make this extension a reality.

Thanks to Bootstrap and Jquery Contributors
